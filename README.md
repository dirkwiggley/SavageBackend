# NodeSQLite
A Node/TypeScript back end that uses better-sqlite3 to provide services

This project is intended to be a starting point for any Node based backend you might want to build. 

The .env file and database file provided is for testing purposes only. You can use this to launch the app right after setting up the app with these files. They contain all of the seed data that you would need to do some basic looking around at what you have to start. Seriously, you'll want a new .env file if you're going to use this for anything other than goofing around!

This app provides a framework for authentication and database access.

USAGE:
1. Download the app
2. Get the node modules: "npm install"
3. Build the app: "npm run build"
4. Run or debug
5. There are seed users Admin/admin and User/user in the default database to play with.

Again, note that if you're going to actually use this for yourself you need to change the values in the .env file and start a new db. There are methods in the app that will create seed values to let you login, etc (read the code).
